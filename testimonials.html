                                            Marta and I have collaborated on a wide range of qualitative and
                                            ethnographic projects over the last ten years. We’ve worked across
                                            therapeutic areas, and we’ve worked through many, many methodologies and
                                            techniques. She is always diligent, insightful, organized, and committed
                                            to excellent results. She is knowledgeable about the markets in both the
                                            UK and Italy, and she always brings a cultural sensitivity to the work
                                            she does. Marta's a pleasure to work with, and an asset on any team.

                                            Marta is a pleasure to work with. After a few years of working with her
                                            in the UK, Germany and Italy I have only good things to report. Marta is
                                            an excellent moderator, comfortable in any situation and able to get to
                                            the heart of the matter. Our projects flow smoothly and Marta always
                                            magnificently manages the unexpected bumps. She truly partners with our
                                            organization always delivering meaningful and on-target learning.

                                            We have worked with Marta on many projects and for well over 5 years and
                                            have without fail, always found her to be extremely capable in all
                                            aspects of conducting qualitative medical market research from
                                            translation of materials, organizing recruitment, facilities and
                                            simultaneous translation; to moderation and analysis of findings. Her
                                            moderating skills are among the very best I have seen (and we have high
                                            standards as most of our work involves Key Opinion Leaders in the
                                            medical space).<br />
                                            <br />
                                            In addition to her notable skills as a researcher, her strengths also
                                            include a wonderfully positive and congenial manner and the team very
                                            much enjoy working with her. She is, without doubt, a very strong
                                            partner and is highly capable of thinking strategically. <br />
                                            <br />
                                            I can honestly say that the team and I cannot identify a single
                                            challenge in working with Marta.
